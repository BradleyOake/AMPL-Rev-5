    Hi, I'm Anthony Walton. I am a soon-to-be graduate of the 3-year Computer Programmer Analyst program from Durham College. I have a wonderful fiance√© (Soon-to-be wife!) and two kids, who keep me busy when I'm not working. I have always loved computers, ever since the first computer I had way back when your computer plugged right into the wall outlet for internet and you had to cover it with a blanket late at night so your parents didn't hear it connecting!
    I am a hardcore gamer as most would call it, I love playing video games whenever I can. I mostly play at the moment League of Legends, Path of Exile, Minecraft, and Final Fantasy 13 series (On PS3). My game taste changes frequently though, so I usually rotate through games quite often.
    Besides that, career-wise I love doing web development, being able to create things and see a nice, finished, polished product is very fulfilling. I am grateful to AMPL Publishing for giving me the opportunity to be part of the group creating the 5th generation of their site!
