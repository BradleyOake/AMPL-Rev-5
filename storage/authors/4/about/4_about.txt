     Meena Mason has loved story telling since the tender age of six.  She recalls her grade one teacher, on several occasions, sending students out into the hallway to dictate stories to parent volunteers.  Meena had no trouble filling pages, only with the time limit.  Her teacher often had to remind an engrossed parent that it was time for Meena to return to class.            Over the years, Meena has written many works of fiction, which entertained close friends and family.  In her first year of college, Meena received critical acclaim, and the highest grade, from her Villains in Literature & Film professor for her short story: Shadow Villain.          In her youth, she discovered the inspiring stories of C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Louis L'Amour and enjoyed reading various mysteries and Arthurian Legends.  Her affection for fantasy and mystery has never diminished.          Like her heroine, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Meena has a deep love of nature and all things living, which is evident in many of her works.  She writes for the pure love of writing and hopes to provide her readers with simple pleasure and uplifting entertainment.  Meena currently lives in Ontario, Canada with her husband, son and three cats.
