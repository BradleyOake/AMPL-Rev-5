Born 1986, in Hong Kong, China, Emanuel Silva traveled the world as a child with his mother and older brother, finally settling back in his family's home country, Portugal, at the age of six. Having spent most of his childhood being best-friends with videogames, movies and books, he never lost the habit of spending hours on end immersing himself in stories of fantasy and sci-fi worlds.   Emanuel started writing "Demon's Blood" as an experimental hobby, to give use to his creativity and imagination, to try and create his own world from scrap. As the words kept pouring out, it became a larger project, eventually seeing the light of day as his first published novel.  Characters are the soul of a story, for Emanuel, and because of that his writing is usually heavily focused on character development and interactions. Fiction is what he lives for; fantasy, horror and sci-fi blend together to bring life to the worlds he creates.To read more about Emanuel Silva and his writing, <a href="http://www.emanuel-silva.com/">please read Emanuel's personal website. </a>
