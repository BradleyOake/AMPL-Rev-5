                    <p>
                        AMPL doesn’t insist you use our services and welcomes you to find/use your own.  We do require six months before re-submission and ask that you provide the name/contact information of editor(s), or company(s) you employed to perform the service(s).
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Option 2 - Pay up front </h4>
                    <p>
                        AMPL accepts Payments via cheque or PayPal.

                    <h4 class="text-center">Option 3 - Subtracted from Royalties*</h4>
                    <p>
                        An agreed upon amount will be deducted from royalties based on a set number of sales. The set number of sales depends on the services selected and the price of each book. Option 3 requires negotiations with the AMPL team and is individually based.
